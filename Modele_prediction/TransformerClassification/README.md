Implementation of the transformer model for emg movement classification

# Important

The data needs to be a .npy file.  
The training will be faster with an nvidia gpu.  

## Modules needed

The following modules need to be installed in your python environnement:  
- sklearn  
- tensorflow  
- numpy  

## Execution 

To train the model open the main.py file and replace the path in the file_path variable.   
The path has to be relative to the main.py file.  
You also need to change the categories in main.py to your movement type.  
The movement type needs to be the name of your file.
